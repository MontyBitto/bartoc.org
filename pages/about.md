The **Basic Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications (BARTOC)** is
a database of Knowledge Organization Systems and KOS related registries.

The main goal of BARTOC is
to list as many Knowledge Organization Systems as possible at one place
in order to achieve greater visibility, highlight their features, make
them searchable and comparable, and foster knowledge sharing. BARTOC
includes any kind of KOS from any subject area, in any language, any
publication format, and any form of accessibility. BARTOCâ€™s search
interface is available in 20 European languages and provides two search
options: Basic Search by keywords, and Advanced Search by taxonomy
terms. A [circle of editors](/contact) has gathered around BARTOC from all across
Europe and BARTOC has been approved by
the [International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO)](http://www.isko.org/).

BARTOC was founded by Andreas Ledl as the Basel Register of Thesauri,
Ontologies & Classifications at [Basel University Library, Switzerland](https://www.ub.unibas.ch/).
In 2020 the database moved to the Verbundzentrale des GBV (VZG), Germany and
got renamed and ported from Drupal to a new [technical infrastructure](/contributing).
The implementation is [fully available](https://github.com/gbv/bartoc.org) as Open Source.
