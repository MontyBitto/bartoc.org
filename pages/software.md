Many software tools exist to manage knowledge organization systems. Even a simple text editor can be used for small vocabularies. More specialized vocabulary software better supports features such as editing, import, export, quality control and workflows. In extension of the report [*Open Source web applications for Knowledge Organization Systems*](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/publications/tr7.html) (2016, <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.61262>) we started a **[wiki page to collect software for controlled vocabularies](https://github.com/gbv/bartoc.org/wiki/Software-for-controlled-vocabularies)**. Contributions are welcome!
