{"no name":"<a href=\"/en/node/1785\">SISS Vocabulary Services</a>","Body":"<p>\"Every service or dataset in a distributed system makes claims about 'what it is' or 'what this item is' or 'what list this term comes from'. This means that \"Controlled Vocabularies\", or more generally classifiers are at the base of the interoperability stack. Every other service or dataset needs to be able to refer to items from lists, or the entire lists. In some cases such vocabularies can be used to populate menus. In other cases it is merely a matter of ensuring that comparisons are between like things. In the most sophisticated cases 'semantic mediation' relies on either reference vocabularies or at least requires that the definitions being compared are available through the same networks.<br />\nThe emergence of Semantic Web technologies has provided some powerful tools for formalizing definitions, vocabularies, and ontologies, in forms that also support reasoning and inferencing. In particular, the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is based on a vocabulary/thesaurus model, and was designed primarily to formalize existing vocabularies using the semantic web tools, and also smooth the transition towards the richer logic-based tools from ontology modeling.<br />\nHowever, so far the standards only provide very low-level interfaces to vocabulary data. For example, the basic query language for RDF data is SPARQL. While this is very powerful, it is at a low level similar to the relational database query language SQL. In the same way that standard database users would never interact with databases using SQL, standard vocabulary users should be provided with an appropriate interface which is based on the structure of vocabulary data, not generic RDF queries.<br />\nThis is the goal of the SISS Vocabulary Services project: to define a standard interface through which standard vocabularies can be provided to web users. The interface is primarily intended for machine-machine use, so that data providers can use HTTP links to vocabularies, data applications can be configured with standard terminology, and data clients can retrieve definitions or verify the existence of items claimed to be in particular vocabularies. Human interface in the form of web pages and forms are also required, but they are secondary to the data-oriented API.<br />\nNote that SISSvoc does not address the issue of vocabulary governance. Its goal is limited to providing a user-friendly web interface to a vocabulary already available from a SPARQL endpoint, [currently read-only]. Vocabulary governance is a tricky thing to generalize since it involves both technical and social aspects. For the SISSvoc deployments at CSIRO we manage the vocabulary content as RDF files in a VCS. Vocabularies are deployed as a file and to an RDF triple-store with a SPARQL endpoint, triggered by creation of an SVN tag.\"</p>\n","Wikidata":"","Link":"<a href=\"https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/RegisterOfVocabularies\">https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/RegisterOfVocabularies</a>","Repository Type":"<a href=\"/en/Full-Repository/Full-terminology-repository-provides-terminology-content\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\">Full terminology repository (provides terminology content)</a>","API":"<a href=\"https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/RegisterOfVocabularies\">https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/RegisterOfVocabularies</a>","DDC Main Class":"","DDC":"","Topic":"","Year of Creation":"","Year of Dissolution":""}

To the human eye, the similarity is obvious but a computer would not be able to interpret these as the same thing unless all the possible options were hard coded into its software. If data are marked up with the same terms, this problem is resolved.</p>\n<p>In the real world, it is not always possible or agreeable for data providers to use the same terms. In such cases, controlled vocabularies can be used as a medium to which data centres can map their equivalent terms.</p>\n<p>The controlled vocabularies delivered by the NERC Vocabulary Server contain the following information for each term:</p>\n<p>    Key — a compact permanent identifier for the term, designed for computer storage rather than human readability<br />\n    Term — the text string representing the term in human-readable form<br />\n    Abbreviation — a concise text string representing the term in human-readable form where space is limited<br />\n    Definition — a full description of what is meant by the term</p>\n<p>All of the vocabularies are fully versioned and a permanent record is kept of all changes made.</p>\n<p>Version 2.0 of the Server (NVS2.0), developed as part of the Open Service Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, represents a complete rewrite of the internal software with both increased functionality and performance. Although the version 1.1 (V1.1) code will remain operational for the foreseeable future, existing users are urged to convert to NVS2.0 as soon as possible and the development of new V1.1 applications is strongly discouraged. The V1.1 and V1.0 documentation has been maintained as historical documents.</p>\n","Wikidata":"","Link":"<a href=\"http://www.bodc.ac.uk/products/web_services/vocab/\">http://www.bodc.ac.uk/products/web_services/vocab/</a>","Repository Type":"<a href=\"/en/Full-Repository/Full-terminology-repository-provides-terminology-content\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\">Full terminology repository (provides terminology content)</a>","API":"<a href=\"http://www.bodc.ac.uk/products/web_services/vocab/\">http://www.bodc.ac.uk/products/web_services/vocab/</a>","DDC Main Class":"<a href=\"/en/DDC-Class/Pure-Science\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\">Pure Science</a>","DDC":"<a href=\"/en/DDC/23/550-Earth-sciences\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\">550 Earth sciences</a>","Topic":"","Year of Creation":"","Year of Dissolution":""}

In the data \"Mary is a person, her family name is Watson, she lives is the city of San Francisco\", \"Person\" is the class of Mary, \"City\" is the class of San Francisco, \"family name\" and \"lives is\" are properties used to describe a person, the latter acting also as a link between a person and a place.<br />\nA vocabulary in LOV gathers definitions of a set of classes and properties (together simply called terms of the vocabulary), useful to describe specific types of things, or things in a given domain or industry, or things at large but for a specific usage. Terms of vocabularies also provide the links in linked data, in the above case between a Person and a City. The definitions of terms provided by the vocabularies bring clear semantics to descriptions and links, thanks to the formal language they use (some dialect of RDF such as RDFS or OWL). In short, vocabularies provide the semantic glue enabling Data to become meaningful Data.</p>\n","Wikidata":"","Link":"<a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/\">http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/</a>","Repository Type":"<a href=\"/en/Full-Repository/Full-terminology-repository-provides-terminology-content\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\">Full terminology repository (provides terminology content)</a>","API":"<a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/sparql\">http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/sparql</a>","DDC Main Class":"","DDC":"","Topic":"","Year of Creation":"","Year of Dissolution":""}
