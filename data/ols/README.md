# Harvesting data from Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)

The **[Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/)**, listed at https://bartoc.org/en/node/17808 in BARTOC, contains almost 300 ontologies mainly from biomedical sciences. This directory contains scripts to download OLS data and to convert it to JSKOS format for import into BARTOC.

See `Makefile` and `ols2jskos.jq` for implementation.
